# Waves

**Waves** are periodic oscillations within a medium.

There are two directions of waves:

- **Longitudinal waves**: waves which involve the particles of the medium oscillating **parallel** to the direction of energy transfer.
- **Transverse waves**: waves which involve the particles of the medium oscillating **perpendicular** to the direction of energy transfer.

The main features of wave include:

- **Amplitude**: the distance between no displacement and maximum displacement of a particle during an oscillation.
- **Wavelength**: the distance between two consecutive crests or the distance between two consecutive troughs.
- **Period**: the amount of time it takes for a whole cycle of a wave to pass through a point.

Some properties of waves include:

- **Cycle**: the completion of one sequence of an oscillatory pattern. In waves, this is referring to the process which completes one iteration of its oscillation.
- **Frequency**: the amount of times which a particle completes a cycle per unit time.

## Frequency and Period

The relationship between the frequency and the period is:

$$ f=\frac{1}{T} $$

## Phase difference

The **phase difference** is the difference in alignment between two waves which have the same wavelength and frequency.

For example, if one wave is $\pi$ radians ahead of another wave, and both waves have a wavelength more than $\pi$, then the phase difference between the two waves is $\pi$.

## Path difference

The **path difference** is the difference in the distance travelled by two waves when they meet.

## Coherence

When two waves are **coherent**, it means that the two waves have the same wavelength and the same phase difference.

## Interference

Waves can exhibit **interference**, which is the interaction between two waves which causes the resulting amplitude of the two waves to change temporarily.

Given two coherent waves, they may **constructively interfere** or **destructively interfere**, depending on their path differences.

If the path difference between two coherent waves is $0$, then the waves will constructively interfere.

## Light slit experiments

A **light slit experiment** involves a single light source shined at some number of slits. The light travels through, exhibiting a combination of diffraction and interference, eventually showing a pattern on a screen.

### Single-Slit

Light passing through a single slit will exhibit only diffraction but not interference. The diffraction will happen along the edges of the slit and there will be no wave sources to interfere with.

### Double-Slit

Thomas Young conducted the **double-slit experiment**.

The double-slit experiment was famous because it demonstrated for the first time that light could exhibit properties of waves. Most notably, Young was able to demonstrate that light could interfere with each other.

$$ s=\frac{\lambda D}{d} $$

where:

- $s$: the distance between two fringes
- $\lambda$: the wavelength
- $D$: the distance between the slits and the screen
- $d$: the distance between the two slits
