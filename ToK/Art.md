# Art

Aesthetics is a major component of art.

Most works of art contain three aspects:

- Representation
- Expression
- Formalism

## Representation

Roots back to Plato. Looks at art as mimesis (imitation or mimicry). Art should resemble reality.

This is the main view about art up until the 1700s. **Art is not about the art itself but the objective universe and the artists' skill in imitating it**.

A superior piece of art captures the essence of truth. _e.g._ a painting of a tree should look like a tree.

However, imitating reality is a challenge. For example, whose perspective is "reality"?

There is also the question of which reality is being mimicked.

## Expression

Focuses on the art's ability to communicate emotional meaning.

Goes back to Aristotle.

Aristotle saw art as providing **catharsis**, which allowed the audience to feel the emotions intended by the artist through the medium of the artwork.

Art is about the audience and its response to art. It is about how the art makes you feel.

A superior work of art will cause a wide audience to learn an emotional truth and to feel the artist's expression.

This view of art was dominant during the 19th century and into the 20th century.

The skill of the artist is measured by the artist's ability to evoke experiences in the audience.

John Dewey said in _Art as Experience_ that without an audience, there could be no art.

Some problems:

- The intent of the artist may not be felt by the audience. However, has the artist succeeded or failed in this situation? _e.g._ Many read the same novel but have greatly different experiences. They may not even agree on what the novel was really about.
- Some say that the intention of the artist is irrelevant to their art and that all that matters is what the audience feels. Following this definition, then basically anything that causes an emotional reaction could be considered art.

## Formalism

This traces back to the 18th century Immanuel Kant.

It is the intention of the artist to create a work of art that makes something art. _i.e._ art cannot be accidental.

The focus is not on how well the work of art represents reality or moves the audience but about how well the work of art conforms to the goals and ideals of its form of art.

Examples include abstract paintings of Jackson Pollock and Paul-Ã‰mile Borduas.

They don't have representational elements and are often difficult to understand - because sometimes there is nothing to understand.

Some were also criticized as lacking talent: Jackson Pollock essentially threw paint onto canvases.

The skill and craft of the artist has always been appreciated in superior art but the emphasis is on the work of art itself and on the skill of the artist in creating it.

Problems:

- The average person does not have a refined enough knowledge of artistic techniques that allows them to appreciate art based on this definition. However, how much knowledge should be required?
- For formalists, the value of the art is the work, which completely shuts out the audience and make art as something only for the artistically educated elite.
- What if the art does not fit within an existing form? If technology allows a new type of art to develop, then should it be judge, since it has no context for its form? By what criteria should the form of a work of art be judged? Are paintings only about the brushstrokes and the alignment of the objects on the canvas?

## Recent Definitions of Art

### Institutional

This emphasizes the notion of the art world as the source that decides what makes something art (the institution). The art world concept is defined as:

- An artist is a person who participates with understanding in the making of a work of art.
- A work of art is an artifact of a kind created to be presented to an art world public.
- The public is a set of persons the members of which are prepared in some degree to understand an object which is presented to them.
- The art world is the totality of all art world systems.
- An art world system is a framework for the presentation of a work of art by an artist to an art world public.

While this definition has the merit of simplicity, the art world will sort out what is and isn't art, it also has the problem of defining the art world. _e.g._ How much understanding is required to become part of the art world? Can anyone appreciate art or does it require several university degrees?

1. Some advocates of this view use a broad definition: Anyone who wants to appreciate art and who makes the effort can be part of the art world. _e.g._ Anyone can be part of art.
2. Others narrow it down, requiring a level of education and commitment to art appreciation beyond the ability of all but a few.

### Historicist/Traditionalist

Related to the institutional approach is the historical approach, which defines art as something that follows a tradition of things which were (or are) considered works of art at some previous point int time.

This view focuses on the conventions of thought that causes us to declare something a work of art. It emphasizes the tradition definitions of art and judges all new artwork in relation to the past.

Similar criticisms of the institutional view of art applies here too, particularly in relation to who decides what is included in an art history tradition.

There are difficulties with art that is from outside the Western art history tradition.

#### Functions of art

- Art as the expression of emotion
- Art teaches us what is right
