# Stereotype

- A stereotype is defined as a social perception of an individual in terms of group membership or physical attributes // copied from ThinkIB
- Stereotypes are often acquired indirectly from other people and social norms and not from personal experience
- Stereotypes are related to **schemas** that help us understand the world around us

# Prejudice

- Prejudice refers to when one makes a judgment about individuals with very little information about them except their group membership
- Prejudice is an attitude - which means that cognition (schema) is combined with emotion - in this case, often liking or disliking the individual
- Prejudice is always negative

# Discrimination

- Discrimination is a behavior
- Discrimination is based on stereotyping and prejudice

# Theories of Formation of Stereotypes

## Social Identity Theory

- Categorization into in-groups and out-groups (Tajfel 1979)
- People often compare members of their in-groups with members of their out-groups
- People often see their in-groups as more superior
- People tend to see members of their out-groups as homogenous (people tend to think that they are all the same), and see members of their in-groups as more diverse
- Salience is a concept that describes which identity is in the forefront of one's mind. For example, when one is in an IB class, the IB in-group identity will be the most prominent

## Grain of Truth Hypothesis

- Campbell (1967)
- There are two main sources of stereotypes:
  - Personal experience (with individual and groups)
  - Gatekeepers (the media, parents, and other members of our culture)
- States that an experience with an individual from a group is often generalized to a whole group (_e.g._ media portrayals).

## Illusory Correlation

Hamilton and Gifford (1976)

- They didn't like the Grain of Truth Hypothesis
- They argue that stereotypes form from **illusory correlation**
  - People see relationships between two variables even when a correlation doesn't objectively exist (people overestimate the correlation)
- Illusory correlation is a type of a cognitive bias (more or less)
  - Think "confirmation bias"
- There are two types of Illusory Correlation:
  - Expectancy-based: One already has a preconceived notion, and they know that it'll happen, and they look for it.
  - Distinctiveness-based: One is focusing on some behavior that stands out to them; forms when one focuses too much on information that stands out (rather than trying to analyze all information rationally)

# Effects of Stereotypes

Stereotypes influence how one thinks about themselves

## Stereotype Threat

- Negative stereotypes about one's group might make them more anxious. The fear that arises surrounding conforming a negative stereotype is known as a **stereotype threat**.
  - Steele & Aronson (1995) theorize that stereotype threat generates **spotlight anxiety** which causes emotional distress and worry that could result in a more negative performance

## Stereotype Boost

- It has been theorized that positive stereotypes can have the opposite effect and increase confidence and lead to a **stereotype boost**.
