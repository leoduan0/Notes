# Enculturation

**Enculturation** is the process by which people learn the norms of their culture (local culture, not new cultures).

**Gate keepers** are keepers of knowledge; they are the people that end up enculturating others. _e.g._ parents, teachers, or the media (basically anyone who knows about a certain culture more than you do).

**Values enculturation** are values that people who were enculturated have.

# Ways people are enculturated

- Direct tuition: Being directly told
- SCT: Models (someone which a person observes), observational learning, vicarious reinforcement (when the model gets rewarded for doing something)
  - Attention
  - Retention
  - Potential
  - Motivation
- Participatory learning: Learning by doing and engaging - people take ideas from one place and transfer them to another. _e.g._ Playing sports
