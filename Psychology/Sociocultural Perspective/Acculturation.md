# Acculturation

**Acculturation** is the process where one abandons the norms of their old culture and adapt to those of their new culture.

**Integration** refers to when there is an interest in adopting the behaviors and values of the new culture, while still maintaining the original culture.

**Assimilation** refers to when an individual abandons their original culture and adopts the cultural behaviors and values of their new culture.

**Marginalization** refers to when it is not really possible to maintain one's original culture, but because of exclusion or discrimination, it is not possible to assimilate into the new culture.

**Separation** refers to when migrants maintain their own culture and minimize contact with the new culture.

Separation is **not** the voluntary version of marginalization (ability).

# Berry's Acculturation Model

| Does the person consider maintaining their own cultural heritage to be of value? \ Does the person consider developing relationships with the larger society to be of value? | Yes             | No          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Yes                                                                                                                                                                          | Assimilation    | Integration |
| No                                                                                                                                                                           | Marginalization | Separation  |

**Acculturative stress**, also known as **culture shock**, refers to the psychological impact of adaptation to a new culture. As with any type of stress, long term acculturative stress also may lead to reduced mental and physical health.

**Acculturation gaps** refers to the differences in understandings and values between the parents and the children as they go through the process of acculturation.

This occurs when parents have a different acculturation strategy from their children.

**Reverse culture shock** refers to the feeling of surprise, disorientation, confusion, alienation, or frustration experienced when people return to their home culture after living in another culture, and finding that they do not fit in as they used to.

## Cultural Dimensions

**Culture** is a dynamic system of rules, explicit and implicit, established by groups in order to ensure their survival, involving attitudes, values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors (Matsumoto, 2001).

Hofstede (1980) carried out a content-analysis of questionnaires asking people from several different counties how they perceived their work environment. He coined the term **cultural dimensions**, are the values within a culture than influence behavior and cognition.

**Individualist** cultures value achievement, uniqueness, and independence.

**Collectivistic** cultures cultures value social harmony, tradition, and interdependence.

**Power distance** How individuals relate to power and authority.

**Motivation Towards Achievement or Success** Whether a society is driven by competition, achievement, and success, or caring for others and quality of life.

**Uncertainty Avoidance** refers to whether an individual see unknown situations as threatening or challenging.

**Motive** is conveying emotions.

**Long-term orientation** refers to a culture's level of focus on the future or the present and the past. **Short-term orientation** refers to a culture's level of focus on the present (short-term gratification).

**Ecological fallacy** refers to the belief that everyone falls under a trend and align to that culture's dimension (when not _everyone_ does).
