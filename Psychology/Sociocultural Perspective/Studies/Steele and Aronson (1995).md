# Steele and Aronson (1995)

# Background

# Study

## Aim

The researchers wanted to investigate the effect of stereotype threat (which they defined as "being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group") on test performances.

## Procedure

114 black and white students from Stanford University took a test and were told one of two things:

- The test wanted to investigate on their intellectual abilities
- The test wanted to investigate on their problem solving skills
  The two independent variables were:
- The race of the participant
- What they were told that the test was trying to investigate

## Findings

The results showed the black students performed significantly worse than white students when they were told that the test was on their intellectual abilities but similarly to white students when they were told that the test was on their problem solving skills. In other words, black participants performed significantly worse than their white counterparts in the stereotype threat condition whereas black participants performed similarly to their white counterparts in the non-threat condition.
Differences between genders were not significant.

# Analysis

## Positives

- Verbal scores from the SAT of the participants were checked and matched so that everyone had roughly equal verbal abilities.

## Negatives

- The participants were all Stanford University students, thus it is difficult to generalize the findings to the general population.
- Even though verbal scores from the SAT was collected, using a matched-pairs design would have been better.
- There is no direct evidence showing the salience of the black participants' racial identities were at play, thus we cannot be certain that the black participants really experienced a stereotype threat.
