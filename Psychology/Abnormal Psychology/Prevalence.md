# Prevalence

**Point prevalence** is the proportion of a population that has a psychological disorder at a specific point in time.

**Incidence** is the number of new cases diagnosed in a certain period of time within a population. "The past 12 months" is commonly used time frame.

**Lifetime prevalence** is the proportion of a population who, at some point in life, has ever had the disorder.

For MDD:

- Point prevalence: At a global level, over 300 million people are estimated to suffer from depression, equivalent to 4.4% of the world's population.
- Incident: The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 16.2 million US adults had at least one major depressive episode in 2016. This presents 6.7% of the US adult population.
- Lifetime prevalence: Almost one in 8 adults identified symptoms that met the criteria for a mood disorder at some point during their lifetime.

## Limitations

Conclusions may quickly become out of date.

Sample sizes may not be large enough.

Self-reported data might be unreliable.

| 6        | Sometimes     | Barely        | Very        | Sometimes     | Feels sleepy      |
| 7        | 6 hours       | 7 hours       | 8 hours     | 6 hours       | 4-5 hours         |
| 8        | 8 hours       | 9 hours       | 10 hours    | 14 hours      | 10 hours          |

We'll define sleep deprivation as getting less than 7 hours of sleep. Using this definition, we conclude that 80% of our participants are sleep deprived (point prevalence).

## Factors that May Affect Prevalence

One reason for the differences in prevalence rates is that there are different levels of risk factors for different populations _e.g._ Brown and Harris.

A survey by the UK Mental Health Foundation says that men are less likely to seek help than women.

Cultural differences may also affect prevalence rates.
