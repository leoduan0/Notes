# Major Depressive Disorder

## DSM5

- Must present five or more of the following symptoms for at least two weeks:
  - Depressed for most of the day and nearly everyday (consist low mood)
  - Loss of interest or pleasure in something that a person normally enjoys
  - Significant weight loss
  - Insomnia or hypersomnia
  - Psychomotor agitation or retardation
  - Fatigue or loss of energy
  - Feelings of worthlessness or excessive, inappropriate guilt
  - Diminished ability to think or concentrate
  - Recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation (without a specific plan)

## Etiology

Means **explanations**.

## Treatments

## Studies

Kendler et al. (2006).

### Caspi et al. (2003)

Caspi et al. (2003). Undue stress problems (iatrogenic effects: the self-fulfilling prophecy). Diathesis-stress model. Influence of genetic factors and stressful life events.

Strength of the genetic argument:

- Twin studies have been highly reliable in their results.
- Modern research has allowed us to actually locate genetic variations using very large sample sizes.
- Modern research recognizes the interaction of environmental and biological factors and does not use a solely reductionist approach.

Limitations of the genetic argument:

- Correlational studies do not establish a cause-and-effect relationship.
- Twin studies have the problem of population validity - twin samples do not necessarily represent the general population.
- Genetic arguments do not account for the variations in symptomology in different cultures.
- It is not yet clear how genetic markers interact.

## The Serotonin Hypothesis

The theory says that low levels of serotonin causes depression ("chemical balance").

Evidence:

- Altering serotonin levels by diet (neurotransmitter depletion studies) leads to depressive symptoms in formerly depressed patients (Moreno and Delgado 2000).
- The 5-HTT gene studied by Caspi is responsible for serotonin transport.
- Some patients taking SSRIs show improvement of their symptoms.

Limitations:

- We cannot directly measure serotonin in the brain.
- Deliberate attempts to decrease serotonin in non-depressed patients to induce depressive symptoms have not always worked.
- Not all people with depression are successfully treated by SSRIs.
- Not all symptoms of depression can be explained by low serotonin levels (_e.g._ poor decision making, memory distortions)
