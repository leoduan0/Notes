# Major Depressive Disorder

## DSM5

- Must present five or more of the following symptoms for at least two weeks:
  - Depressed for most of the day and nearly everyday (consist low mood)
  - Loss of interest or pleasure in something that a person normally enjoys
  - Significant weight loss
  - Insomnia or hypersomnia
  - Psychomotor agitation or retardation
  - Fatigue or loss of energy
  - Feelings of worthlessness or excessive, inappropriate guilt
  - Diminished ability to think or concentrate
  - Recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation (without a specific plan)

## Etiology

Means **explanations**.

## Treatments

## Studies

Kendler et al. (2006).

### Caspi et al. (2003)

Caspi et al. (2003). Undue stress problems (iatrogenic effects: the self-fulfilling prophecy). Diathesis-stress model. Influence of genetic factors and stressful life events.

Strength of the genetic argument:

- Twin studies have been highly reliable in their results.
- Modern research has allowed us to actually locate genetic variations using very large sample sizes.
- Modern research recognizes the interaction of environmental and biological factors and does not use a solely reductionist approach.

Limitations of the genetic argument:

- Correlational studies do not establish a cause-and-effect relationship.
- Twin studies have the problem of population validity - twin samples do not necessarily represent the general population.
- Genetic arguments do not account for the variations in symptomology in different cultures.
- It is not yet clear how genetic markers interact.

## The Serotonin Hypothesis

The theory says that low levels of serotonin causes depression ("chemical balance").

Evidence:

- Altering serotonin levels by diet (neurotransmitter depletion studies) leads to depressive symptoms in formerly depressed patients (Moreno and Delgado 2000).
- The 5-HTT gene studied by Caspi is responsible for serotonin transport.
- Some patients taking SSRIs show improvement of their symptoms.

Limitations:

- We cannot directly measure serotonin in the brain.
- Deliberate attempts to decrease serotonin in non-depressed patients to induce depressive symptoms have not always worked.
- Not all people with depression are successfully treated by SSRIs.
- Not all symptoms of depression can be explained by low serotonin levels (_e.g._ poor decision making, memory distortions)

## Beck's Cognitive Theory

### The Cognitive Triad

Beck argues that depression is rooted in a patient's "automatic thoughts" - that is, personalized thoughts that are triggered by particular stimuli that leads to emotional responses. The cognitive triad is three types of automatic thoughts.

- Negative views of the world
- Negative views of one self
- Negative view of the future

#### Negative schema

Beck argues that negative schema can develop because of family problems, social rejection by peers, poor school experiences, or by having depressed members of the family or close social circle.

- Ineptness schema
- Self-blame schema
- Negative self-evaluation schema

#### Errors in Logic

- Selective abstraction: drawing conclusions about one self from a single incident.
- Magnification: slippery slope.
- Minimization: can't take compliments (thinks that all praise is flattery).
- Overgeneralization
- Personalization
- Arbitrary inferences: Make conclusions without conclusive evidence (while focusing on the most negative evidence).

## Nolen-Hoeksema's Theory of Depression

Studied the connection between rumination and depression.

Rumination is focusing attention on distressing symptoms or thoughts.

Men were more likely to distract themselves when they feel depressed. Women were more likely to ruminate.

## Sociocultural Theories

Factors:

- Stressors in the environment - fighting at home
- Resources available for coping with stressors - access to counselling
- Cultural explanations for disorders and attitudes towards those that have them 0 somatic vs affective symptoms

Diathesis-stress Model of Depression

- Stress may act as a trigger to activate a biological predisposition to depression, especially when individuals lack resources to cope with the stress.

| Risk factors                                     | Protective Factors              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| - Stressful home environment (fighting, neglect) | - Stable income                 |
| - Unstable/uncertain income                      | - Healthy relationships         |
| - High stress job                                | - Living in a safe neighborhood |
| - Political instability                          | - Education                     |
| - Other mental health disorders (substance use)  | - Access to counselling         |
| - Isolation/loneliness                           | - Access to medical care        |
| - Having young children                          | - Nutritious food               |

## Anti-depressants

### Tricyclics

**Tricyclics** are the first ever anti-depressants to be prescribed.

#### Mechanism

They interfere with the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin and it leads to increased levels of neurotransmitters in the synapse.

#### Side Effects

It had a delayed effect but 50%-70% of patients show improvement within two to three weeks of the beginning of treatment.

There are many side effects, including dry mouth, cardiovascular problems, weight gain, constipation, blurred vision, sexual dysfunction, and disorientation.

Risk of overdose (it's quite toxic).

### SSRI

**Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors** (SSRIs).

#### Mechanism

They inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and lead to increased levels of serotonin in the synapse.

#### Effects

Few side effects (because the mechanism is simpler).

Not as toxic as tricyclics.

Serotonin syndrome (when the level of serotonin is too high).

## MAO Inhibitors

**Monoamine oxidase** is an enzyme that breaks down serotonin.

#### Mechanism

**Monoamine oxidase inhibitors** (MAO inhibitors) are agents that increases the availability of serotonin by inhibiting the action of MAO.Access

#### Effects

Have strong contraindications - cannot eat certain foods while using the medicine. Specifically, it is food with thiamine.

Have side effects.
