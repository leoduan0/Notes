# Vulnerability Models

Argues that when there are more risk factors in an individual's environment than protective factors, one is likely to develop a disorder in the face of provoking agents.

## Brown & Harris (vulnerability model)

Protective factors - protects against the development of depression in spite of stressor _i.e._ high levels of intimacy with one's husband

Risk factors - increases the risk of depression. The most significant vulnerability factors were:

- Loss of one's mother before the age of 11
- Lack of a confiding relationship
- More than three children under the age of 14 at home
- Unemployment

Provoking agents - sudden or specific life events that lead to stress - divorce, death of a loved one.

# Cortisol Hypothesis

Cortisol is a stress hormone.

Chronic stress leads to an excess of cortisol - overactive HPA-axis; hippocampal cell death.

Stress can cause gene expression.

ACEs (adverse childhood experiences) shows the effects of life stressors on physical and mental health.

## Cultural Explanatory Models

Kirmayar says that cultures create socially acceptable sets of symptoms for mental distress. Since cultures are continually evolving, especially in the era of globalization, these explanatory modes may change.

Self-reported, correlational, generalizability, sample size

External factors, holistic

Doesn't explain how some things happen.
